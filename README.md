# 📧 End-to-End Spam Mail Detector

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms. This project is designed to classify incoming emails as **spam** or **not spam (ham)** efficiently and accurately.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Spam emails are a major concern in digital communication. This project aims to build a model that can identify spam emails using machine learning and NLP techniques.

The pipeline includes:
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Model training
- Evaluation
- Deployment-ready logic

---

## 🧠 Features

- Email preprocessing using NLP
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Multiple classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Confusion matrix visualization
